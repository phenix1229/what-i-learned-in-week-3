## Javascript
I learned some more basics of Javascript including:
* Functions:
  * declaring - `function name(){};`
  * invoking - `name();`
* Parameters/arguments:
  * `function name(parameter(s)){};`
  * `name(argument(s));`
* Returning values

## String methods
I learned some of the built-in methods for altering/working with strings, including:
* `.toUpperCase` - to change all items in string to uppercase
* `.toLowerCase` - to change all items in string to lowercase
* `.length` - to find length of a string
* `.indexOf('')` - to find the index number of an item in a string
*

## Challenges

My biggest challenges were keeping track of scope when dealing with variables (local vs global), and minding syntax.
